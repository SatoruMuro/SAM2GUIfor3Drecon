## 📦 Download and Launch the App

1. Download the application from the following link:  
👉 [Download AlignRef.zip via Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dggt20l4g0w8cgq097i35/AlignRef.zip?rlkey=fck23rub5t2edgyxcn0ycnvpq&st=hb6skgpf&dl=1)

2. Unzip the file and create a dedicated folder such as `C:\AlignRef\`, then place **all contents** of the ZIP file into that folder  
   (including `AlignRef.exe` and the `_internal` folder).  
❗ Avoid placing the folder in locations with **long paths, Japanese characters, or spaces** (e.g., Desktop or Documents), as this may cause runtime errors.

3. Double-click `AlignRef.exe` to launch the application.

> ⚠️ If Windows SmartScreen shows a warning, click “More info” → “Run anyway” to proceed.  
> ❗ Do **not delete** the `_internal` folder. It is required for the app to run properly.
